# My personal Express Starter Kit CLI

The Express Starter Kit CLI is a simple and efficient command-line tool to instantciate an Express.js application with predefined templates for different languages and databases. This tool helps me quickly set up a project, saving time on boilerplate configuration.

## Features

- Interactive CLI: Prompts to guide you through project setup.
- Language Options: Choose between JavaScript or TypeScript for your application.
- Database Support: Select either PostgreSQL or MongoDB as your database.
- Automatic Scaffolding: Creates a project folder with the necessary files and structure based on your selections.
  Ready to Start: After setup, the project is ready for installation and development.

## Installation

Ensure you have Node.js (version 16 or higher) installed on your system.

```
git clone git@github.com:Ekefrancisokechukwu/express-starter-kit.git
```

```javascript
// Navigate to the project directory
cd express-starter-kit

//Install dependencies:
npm install

// Link the CLI globally (optional)
npm link

```
